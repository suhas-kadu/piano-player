# Piano Player

## Inspiration

Recently I learned about Arduino. So I decided to explore more about Arduino and try building projects. Due to this pandemic I was not able to gather the hardware, but I have developed a simulation of hardware which is a Piano Player, using simple electronic components.

## What it does

It is a very simple project. User can play various tones of different frequencies by just pressing the buttons.

## How we built it

It is developed on Tinkercad, which is a online platform for hardware simulation. I have used Arduino, push buttons and buzzers to build this project. I have used Embedded-C for coding.

## Challenges we ran into

The challenge to manage the conditions regarding the states(ON/OFF) of buttons.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I have successfully developed my first simulation of my first hardware project, in my first hackathon.

## What we learned

I have learned about Arduino and how to write the code for Arduino.

## What's next for Piano Player

In future I'll try to add more tunes and a RGB led which will turn ON after pressing a button.
